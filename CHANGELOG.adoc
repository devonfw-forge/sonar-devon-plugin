== 3.0.0

This is the first official release. In http://devonfw.com[devonfw] all released artifacts share the same version number.
This allows to easily see which artifacts belong together and are guaranteed to be compatible. As this plugin was later
added to devonfw, it started with the devonfw version for that moment in time what was 3.0.0. As `3.1.0` of `devonfw` came out immediately after there never was a release `3.1.0` of this plugin. Starting with `3.2.0` this plugin is now officially part of `devonfw` and will be released consistently.
